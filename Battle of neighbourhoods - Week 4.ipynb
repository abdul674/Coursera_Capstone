Introduction Section: Discussion of the business problem and the audience who would be interested in this project.\n\n### Description of the Problem and Background\n\n### Scenario:\n\nI am a data scientist residing in Lahore, Pakistan. I currently live within walking distance to a market and I enjoy many ammenities and venues in the area, such as various international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. I have been offered a great opportunity to work for a leader firm in Manhattan, NY. I am very excited and I want to use this opportunity to practice my learnings in Coursera in order to answer relevant questions arisen. The key question is : How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place similar to mine now in Pakistan? Certainly, I can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Apartment must be 2 or 3 bedrooms</li>\n    <li>Desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) radius</li>\n    <li>Price of rent must not exceed 7,000 per month</li>\n    <li>Top ammenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence</li>\n    <li>Desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, restaurants, gym and food shops</li>\n    <li>As a reference, I have included a map of venues near current residence in Tanzania.</li>\n</ul>\n\n### Business Problem:\n\nThe challenge is to find a suitable apartment for rent in Manhattan NY that complies with the demands on location, price and venues. The data required to resolve this challenge is described in the following section 2, below.\n\n### Interested Audience\n\nI believe this is a relevant challenge with valid questions for anyone moving to other large city in US, EU or Asia. The same methodology can be applied in accordance to demands as applicable. This case is also applicable for anyone interested in exploring starting or locating a new business in any city. Lastly, it can also serve as a good practical exercise to develop Data Science skills.\n\n## 2. Data Section:\n\n### Description of the data and its sources that will be used to solve the problem\n\nI Currently reside in GECHS in the city of Lahore. I use Foursquare to identify the venues around the area of residence which are then shown in the Lahore, Link Road map shown in methodology and execution in section 3.0. It serves as a reference for comparison with the desired future location in Manhattan NY.\n\n### Description of the Data\n\nThe following data is required to answer the issues of the problem:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>List of Boroughs and neighborhoods of Manhattan with their geodata (latitude and longitude)</li>\n    <li>List of Subway metro stations in Manhattan with their address location</li>\n    <li>List of apartments for rent in Manhattan area with their addresses and price</li>\n    <li>Preferably, a list of apartment for rent with additional information, such as price, address, area, number of beds, etc</li>\n    <li>Venues for each Manhattan neighborhood (than can be clustered)</li>\n    <li>Venues for subway metro stations, as needed</li>\n</ul>\n\n## 2.2 Data Required to resolve the problem\n\nIn order to make a good choice of a similar apartment in Manhattan NY, the following data is required: List/Information on neighborhoods form Manhattan with their Geodata (latitude and longitude. List/Information about the subway metro stations in Manhattan with geodata. Listed apartments for rent in Manhattan area with descriptions (how many beds, price, location, address) Venues and Ammenities in the Manhattan neighborhoods (e.g. top 10) 2.3 sources and manipulation The list of Manhattan neighborhoods is worked out during Lab exercise during the course. A csv file was created which will be read in order to create a dataframe and its mapping. The csv file 'mh_neigh_data.csv' has the following below data structure. The file will be directly read to the Jupiter Notebook for convenience and space savings. The clustering of neighborhoods and mapping will be shown however. An algorithm was used to determine the geodata from Nominatim . The actual algorithm coding may be shown in 'markdown' mode becasues it takes time to run.\n\nA list of Manhattan subway metro stops was complied in Numbers (Apple excel) and it was complemeted with wikipedia data ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_City_Subway_stations_in_Manhattan) and information from NY Transit authority and Google maps (https://www.google.com/maps/search/manhattan+subway+metro+stations/@40.7837297,-74.1033043,11z/data=!3m1!4b1) for a final consolidated list of subway stops names and their address. The geolocation was obtained via an algorythm using Nominatim. Details will be shown in the execution of methodolody in section 3.0.\n\nA list of places for rent was collected by web-browsing real estate companies in Manhattan : http://www.rentmanhattan.com/index.cfm?page=search&state=results https://www.nestpick.com/search?city=new-york&page=1&order=relevance&district=manhattan&gclid=CjwKCAiAjNjgBRAgEiwAGLlf2hkP3A-cPxjZYkURqQEswQK2jKQEpv_MvKcrIhRWRzNkc_r-fGi0lxoCA7cQAvD_BwE&type=apartment&display=list https://www.realtor.com/apartments/Manhattan_NY A csv file was compiled with the rental place that indicated: areas of Manhattan, address, number of beds, area and monthly rental price. The csv file \"nnnn.csv\" had the following below structure. An algorithm was used to create all the geodata using Nominatim, as shown in section 3.0. The actual algorithm coding may be shown in 'markdown' mode becasues it takes time to run. With the use of geolocator = Nominatim() , it was possible to determine the latitude and longiude for the subway metro locations as well as for the geodata for each rental place listed. The loop algorithms used are shown in the execution of data in section 3.0 \"Great_circle\" function from geolocator was used to calculate distances between two points , as in the case to calculate average rent price for units around each subway station and at 1.6 km radius. Foursquare is used to find the avenues at Manhattan neighborhoods in general and a cluster is created to later be able to search for the venues depending of the location shown.\n\n## 2.3 How the data will be used to solve the problem\n\nThe data will be used as follows:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Use Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all Manhattan neighborhoods and clustered in groups ( as per Course LAB)</li>\n    <li>Use foursquare and geopy data to map the location of subway metro stations , separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to be able to identify the venues and ammenities near each metro station, or explore each subway location separately.</li>\n    <li>Use Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of rental places, in some form, linked to the subway locations.</li>\n    <li>create a map that depicts, for instance, the average rental price per square ft, around a radious of 1.0 mile (1.6 km) around each subway station - or a similar metrics. I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.</li>\n    <li>Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat,long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.</li>\n    <li>Data will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n## The procesing of these DATA will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>What is the cost of rent (per square ft) around a mile radius from each subway metro station?</li>\n    <li>What is the area of Manhattan with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?</li>\n    <li>What is the distance from work place ( Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future home?</li>\n    <li>What are the venues of the two best places to live? How the prices compare?</li>\n    <li>How venues distribute among Manhattan neighborhoods and around metro stations?</li>\n    <li>Are there tradeoffs between size and price and location?</li>\n    <li>Any other interesting statistical data findings of the real estate and overall data.</li>\n</ul>"
